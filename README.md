# push_swap
A duo of programs that return a list of instructions that sort a stack of integers and validate that the list is sorted.

## Compilation and Running
Run the included Makefile to compile the two programs.

To run push_swap by itself type into the terminal:
```bash
./push_swap (list of numbers)
```
To run the checker by itself type into the terminal:
```bash
./checker (list of numbers)
```

To verify that the list of instructions generated by push_swap sort the list type:
```bash
./push_swap (list of numbers) | ./checker (list of numbers)
```

## Push_swap Program
The push_swap program generates a list of instructions that sort a stack of integers using the original stack (A) and a second helper stack (B).
The program manipulates the stacks using the following instructions:

* __sa__ - swaps the order of the first two values in stack A.
* __sb__ - swaps the order of the first two values in stack B.
* __ss__ - swaps the order of the first two values in both stacks.
* __pa__ - moves the first element of stack A to the top of stack B.
* __pb__ - moves the first element of stack B to the top of stack A.
* __ra__ - moves the first element of stack A to the bottom of stack A.
* __rb__ - moves the first element of stack B to the bottom of stack B.
* __rr__ - performs __ra__ and __rb__ simultaneously.
* __rra__ - moves the last element of stack A to the top of stack A.
* __rrb__ - moves the last element of stack B to the top of stack B.
* __rrr__ - performs __rra__ and __rrb__ simultaneously.

## Checker Program
The checker program verifies that the provided list of numbers can be sorted using instructions either typed in by the user or piped in from the push_swap program.
